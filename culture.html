    <h2>Our Message</h2>
    <p>This website was created to fight ignorance through educating people about different cultures around the world. We want everyone to feel accepted and welcome in our community, and to have pride in who they are and where they came from. We believe that everyone deserves to have a seat at the table and be able to express themselves freely. A lot of this information has come from both personal experiences as well as research. If you would like to contribute, please leave a respectful comment in our forum. (Constructive criticism is allowed) <p/>
